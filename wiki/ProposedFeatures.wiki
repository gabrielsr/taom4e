#summary Propose features for the next release, TAOM4E 1.0

  * Automatic layout and arrangements 
  * Interoperability with UML and other tools 
  * Code generation extension 
  * Test generation extension


(Mirko)My proposed high-priority "features": 

- no "featuritis" 

- a stable modeller 

- user frendly and easy to install for students 

- guides through the methodology (as Jorge Gomez said: the tool defines the methodology - or: we have a good tool if it can do the things mentioned in the methodology (not less and not more). 

- an API to the files (as there is something also now) that can be simply used to work with Tropos files, also outside Eclipse plugins. This saves a lot of work on the "extensions" parts that do not need a graphical interface - yust do in the old Unix way and work on files. 

- A well-documented border between generated and hand-written code and the possibility to re-generate the code and run it without problems: Warrantees that the metamodel and graphical models can be changed.


- one important additional feature: a complete graphical view of all the model objects and Zoom features.
